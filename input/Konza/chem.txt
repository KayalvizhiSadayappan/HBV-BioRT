ACTIVITY        1       # correction of activity: 0 = no correction, 1 = Debye-Huckel Equation
TRANSPORT_ONLY  0       # transport only mode: 0 = turn on reactions, 1 = transport only, suitable for stable tracer transport problems
SF_REACTION     1       # surface reaction mode: 0 = surface reactions are not simulated; 1: surface reactions are simulated
